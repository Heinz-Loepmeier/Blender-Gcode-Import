Import G-code from slicer to Blender paths


Having access to the toolspaths directly let's you do some interesting things conventional slicers can't do.
I've been using the importer in conjunction with Alessandro Zomperellis Gcode exporter for Blender.


For some Blender operations it helps if the paths are evenly subdivided to give some modifiers the necessary resolution.
Use the 'subdivide' option in the importer for that.

Another option is to split the layers into single Blender objects, makes editing or animating them easier.


Here are some examples of Blenders internal tools for path manipulation.
